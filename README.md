1. What is Java ?
* High level language, object oriented, platform independent, portable, secure, robust, high performance, multithreaded
* platform

2. What are the differences between C++ and Java ?

3. List the features of Java Programming language ?
* object oriented, high level, robust, secure, portable, high performance, multithreaded, platform independent, distributed

4. What do you understand by JVM ?
* Enables java to be platform independent
* provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode
* Functions - loads and verifies bytecode, Manages memory - Handles allocation (heap, stack) and garbage collection, Just in time compilation, 

5. What are the differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
* JVM - provides a runtime environment
* JRE - JVM + libraries
* JDK - JRE + development tools

6. How many types of memory areas are allocated by the JVM?
* stack - method calls, local variables 
* heap - objects, arrays (shared across threads)
* program counter register - current execution address 
* native method stack - Used for native method (written in C/C++)
* Method area - class metadata, static variables (shared across threads)

7. What is JIT compiler?
* JVM interprets bytecode line by line 
* JIT compiler identifies hotspots(frequently executed code)
* Compiles these hotspot into optimized native machine code

8. What is the platform?
* Combination of software and hardware on which programs run 

9. What are the main differences between the Java platform and other platforms?
* Java is write once run anywhere
* other programming languages may be need platform specific code/compilation

10. What gives Java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature?
* Java compiler converts Java code to class files(byte code)
* Intermediate language between Java code and the machine code is bytecode
* byte makes java platform independent, and can be executed in any platform with a compatible JVM
